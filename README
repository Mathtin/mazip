NAME
       mazip - compress or expand files

SYNOPSIS
       mazip [ -cdlrt19 ] [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       MaZIP reduces the size of the named files using BWT (Burrows–Wheeler transform), MFT (Move-to-front) and AC (Arithmetic coding), by creating another file with same name and suffix ".mz".

       Compressed files can be restored to their original form using mazip -d.

OPTIONS
       -c
              Write output on standard output. If there are several input files, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members. To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them.

       -d
              Decompress.

       -l
              For each compressed file, list the following fields:

                  compressed size: size of the compressed file
                  uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
                  ratio: compression ratio
                  uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

       -r
              Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names specified on the command  line  are  directories, mazip will descend into the directory and compress all the files it finds there.

       -t --test
              Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       -1 -9
              Regulate  the  speed  of compression using the specified digit #, where -1 indicates the fastest compression method (less compression) and -9 indicates the slowest compression method (best compression).
